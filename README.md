The Iron Yard Academy Week 1

My very first homework assignment at The Iron Yard Academy. The assignment was given after our very first day
of lecture on HTML/CSS. My only prior exposure to HTML or CSS was a casual stroll through tutorials on Codecademy
in the weeks leading up to The Academy. We were told to, 'make something pretty.' Ha! I'll leave it to the critics
to decide whether or not I succeeded.
